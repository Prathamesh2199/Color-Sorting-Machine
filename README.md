# Color-Sorting-Machine
All we need for this Arduino project is one color sensor (TCS3200) and two servo motors. In this project Color sensor detect the color of candy and generate output in this output sensor data transfer to Arduino, Arduino will process those data according to code uploaded in it and command servo to move and sort color candy on basis of there color. APPLICATIONS-: Color Sorting machines are used for food processing industry, such as coffee, nuts, and oil crops. Compared with manual sorting: machines saving labor and time, with higher high efficiency, and lower processing costs.
